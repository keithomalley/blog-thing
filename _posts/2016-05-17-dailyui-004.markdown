Today's [DailyUI challenge][daily_ui]! is a [calculator][dailyui_004], I made it with some clean white backgrounds and drop-shadows, highlighting some elements with colour and others with size. I'm really getting into using subtle gradients again to which makes a lot of difference to designs I find.

Pretty happy with this one, design time was only about ~30 mins - 1 hour. As usual you can see my design posted on [dribbble][dailyui_004].
