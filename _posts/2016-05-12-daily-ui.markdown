Starting today I'm going to get into doing the [DailyUI challenge][daily_ui]. It's a 100-day challenge that sends you a UI element topic to design every day (except weekends) so that you can practice in your off time.

This is extremely handy as I've found that part of the problem with practice is deciding what to make and being driven to make it. The [first day][dailyui_001] is a signup form so I made it pretty simple. I'm thinking after the first round of the UI challenge I might go back and revisit each design I make and rebound them on dribbble to improve on them.

![Day 1 was a sign up form](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/194727/screenshots/2710402/dailyui_001.png)

I'll be posting up what I make both here and on [dribbble][dribbble_profile] so I can keep track of it and share it with people while I job-hunt ðŸ™‚ Also going to do this so I can beef up my portfolio, and share over on [twitter][twitter_profile] to start getting into working on things!
