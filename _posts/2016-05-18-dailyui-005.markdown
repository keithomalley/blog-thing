Today's [DailyUI][daily_ui]! is an [app icon][dailyui_005], been continuing the subtle gradients thing but I couldn't get much inspiration for this one so it's pretty minimal. I went with an OSX-style icon for a night-time/weather app or some sort (you can tell how uninspired I am today, not even concrete idea).

Anyway it's a process to come up with stuff! :)

As usual you can see my design posted on [dribbble][dailyui_004].
